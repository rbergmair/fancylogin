Fancy-login provides a very big set of options, to set
the look and feel of you personal login-screen.

The configuration uses 4 files:
/etc/signon.colors
/etc/signon.defs
/etc/signon.fail
/etc/signon.text

let's begin with

**********************
/etc/signon.defs
**********************

here is a sample signon.defs:
-------------------------------------------------------------
color        2        WHITE       RED
color        1        WHITE       BLUE
color        0        WHITE       BLACK

username    15        57          10                      1
password    18        57          10                      1
failure     6         32          2
--------------------------------------------------------------

the first three statements (beginning with "color") create
the curses-color-pairs, and assign them to a number.
The first parameter, we give on that line is the number,
to assign the color-pair to, the second parameter is the
foreground-color, the third parameter is the background-color.
We will discuss the use of those numbers, and the assigned
colors later in this document.

the next statement is the username-statement. This just defines
some parameters we need for the username-input-mask. The first
parameter is the y-coordinate of the mask, the second one is
the x-coordinate, the third one is the number of characters, to
be accepted and the fourth is the color, to use for the mask.

the password-statement is the same as the username-statement,
just it belongs to the password-mask.

failure defines the position and color-pair to use for the box,
that is displayed, when a login fails. The first parameter is
the y-coordinate again, and the second one the x-coordinate. The
last number is the color-pair to use for displaying it.



*****************
/etc/signon.text
*****************

is a text-file that is displayed for the login.
NOTE THAT THIS FILE HAS TO HAVE 25*80 CHARACTERS! Therefore
you should fill out the space you don't need with blanks.



*******************
/etc/signon.colors
*******************

also has 25*80 characters. Each character is the number
of a color-pair you want to be displayed at the position, of
the screen, where you put it in textfile. This sounds a
little bit complicated, but isn't. Just look at the sample
configuration, and you'll understand.



*****************
/etc/signon.fail
*****************

Is a textfile, that contains the text to be displayed
in the messagebox for failed logins.
