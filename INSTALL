                       -----------------------------
                            fancylogin 0.99.7

                           basic installation
                               instructions
                       -----------------------------



-----------------------------------------------------
STEP 1: CHECK DEPENDENCIES
-----------------------------------------------------

fancylogin needs the following libraries:
- libcrypt

the fancylogin-theme-creator fltcreate needs:
- libreadline



-----------------------------------------------------
STEP 2: MODIFY Makefile
-----------------------------------------------------

Have a look at the Makefiles and modify them for
your system (espectially the first few lines).
If you don't know anything about "make" and "Makefiles"
just forget about that.



-----------------------------------------------------
STEP 3: MODIFY Precompiler-Options
-----------------------------------------------------

have a look at config.h and environment.h,
the configuration options are explained in
the files. If you're very lazy you can also
skip this step, but you better don't!



------------------------------------------
STEP 4: COMPILE THE sourcedistribution
------------------------------------------

you can compile everything by entering
"make all" in the root directory of the
sourcedistribution.



------------------------------------------
STEP 5: CONFIGURE THE login
------------------------------------------

once you should have a look at the
documentation to configure fancylogin
the way you want, but "make sampleconf"
should get you started with a Welcome2L-
screeen and some standard-configuration,
which you can modify when you have time.
You ALSO HAVE TO DO THAT, IF YOU ALREADY
HAD A 0.99.6-CONFIGURATION, because
the configuration has changed!



------------------------------------------
STEP 6: TRY OUT fancylogin
------------------------------------------

go to the directory ./login and invoke
fancylogin from command-line (when you are
logged in as superuser). Everything should
work already!! You should be able to login,
and when you log out again, you are on
the comand-line again.



------------------------------------------
STEP 7: INSTALL fancylogin
------------------------------------------

if everything went okay when trying out,
you can install fancylogin to your system.
just enter "make install" in the
distribution-root.



----------------------------
STEP 8: MODIFY /etc/inittab
----------------------------

Okay, now it's getting a little bit complicated,
I will try to explain the startup-process, so you
know what you are doing, when modifying your
/etc/inittab-file. When the kernel boots up and
mounts your root partition it executes your
init-program, that can be configured using the file
/etc/inittab. On a normal (non-fancylogin)-system
init runs the program "mingetty" on every console.
mingetty sets up the virtual console, and then
executes the program /bin/login. In our case we
don't want to execute /bin/login, because we want
/bin/fancylogin to be executed instead. "make install"
should have compiled my modification of mingetty
which executes /bin/fancylogin instead. This program
is installed as /sbin/mingetty.fancylogin. So you
have to tell your init to execute /sbin/mingetty.fancylogin
instead of /sbin/mingetty. You can do this by modifying
some lines in /etc/inittab that look like

4:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty tty4
                     ~~~~~~~~

instead you should have

4:2345:respawn:/sbin/mingetty.fancylogin tty4
                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

in your inittab.
Maybe it's a good idea to leave the normal mingetty
running on one terminal, so if anything happens you
can still login.


-----------------------------------------------------
CONGRATULATIONS!
You have just successfully installed fancylogin. The
next time you start up your system you should see a
Welcome2L screen!
