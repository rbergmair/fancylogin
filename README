This is the README for the fancy-login:

NOTE THAT FANCYLOGIN IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH NORMAL LOGIN. UNDER NO
CIRCUMSTANCES REPLACE YOU EXISTING LOGIN BY THE FANCY-LOGIN. FANCY-
LOGIN WILL ONLY WORK ON VIRTUAL TTYs (/dev/tty??) DO NOT USE IT FOR
MODEMS, TELNET OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT!

AT THIS POINT OF DEVELOPMENT FANCYLOGIN IS ABSOLUTELY INSECURE. DO
NOT USE IT IF IT IS IMPORTANT FOR YOUR SYSTEM TO SUPPORT VERY SECURE
LOGINS ON VIRTUAL TERMINALS. NOTHING IS LOGGED, NOT ERROR MESSAGES
ARE DISPLAYED, OR SENT VIA SYSLOG!



********************************************************************************
WHAT IS FANCYLOGIN AND WHAT CAN I USE IT FOR?
********************************************************************************

Fancylogin is an ncurses-powered login-program, that creates
very colorful and high-configurable login-screens with inputmasks.
Although it works with telnet, never use it with network-services,
and under no circumstances replace your old login-program with fancylogin.
Fancylogin is supposed to be an addition to your normal login program.
It has no security-capabilities. It doesn't log anything, it doesn't
send error-messages through syslog, actually it does nothing than prompt
for a username/password pair, and log you in if it is correct. We are
planning to add support for syslogd, so fancylogin gets a little bit better.
The code is not very robust at this time of development, but it works.



********************************************************************************
DEPENDENCIES
********************************************************************************

The fancy-login login-program requires the ncurses-libraries and
the standard libc.



********************************************************************************
INSTALLATION
********************************************************************************

First you have to compile the sources. This is done by doing "make"
in ./src

---------------------
cd src
make
cd ..
---------------------

now youve got a file ./fancylogin and /bin/fancylogin

IMPORTANT: TRY OUT FANCYLOGIN BEFORE PROCEEDING WITH THE INSTALLATION!
this is done by just typing

---------------------
fancylogin
---------------------

try logging in with an existing username, with one that doesn't exist,
try out root-login, and non-root-logins, try typing correct and incorrect
passwords. If everything is functioning correctrly, proceed with the
installation, else send a report to the authors mentioned below.

Now you need a modified getty for your virtual-terminals, that doesn't
prompt for a username, and that executes /bin/fancylogin instead of
/bin/login. I've added a modified version of mingetty. just compile it by
doing

------------------------------
cd mingetty-0.9.4-fancylogin
make
------------------------------

I haven't added installation of the binary to the Makefile, because
I want you to do this manually, so you know exactly, what is going
on, because if it doesn't work you must know how to undo it.

First try out the new binary by typing

-----------
./mingetty
-----------

If you get no error-message such as "Segmentation fault" or something
like that, you can proceed:

First rename your old mingetty, so you can restore it,
if it doesn't work:

---------------------------------------
mv /sbin/mingetty /sbin/mingetty.old
---------------------------------------

Now copy the new mingetty to your sbin folder:

-------------------
cp mingetty /sbin
-------------------

DO NOT LOG OUT YET!

Before logging out on the terminal you are currently
working on, log in and out again on another virtual
terminal.

If you get a fancylogin-prompt now, the
installation was successful, and you can log in and
out on all consoles, or just reboot the system.

* If you don't get a fancylogin-prompt restore
* the old mingetty, by typing
*
* -------------------------------------
* rm /sbin/mingetty
* mv /sbin/mingetty.old /sbin/mingetty
* -------------------------------------
*
* and send a bug-report to the authors mentioned below.
