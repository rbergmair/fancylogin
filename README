fancylogin is one of the most powerful login-programs
available for LINUX, and UNIXes generally. fancylogin
can do everything your old login program can do (supports
shadow-passwords, user-time-terminal/network-verification
as done with HP-UX-login (/etc/usertty, /etc/securetty),
and adds a lot of capabilities for logging and draws
login-masks that are REALLY FANCY (didn't think so, eh')!

in version 0.99.6 we are not yet able to "revolutionize"
everything you know about logins, but we have lots of
plans on doing so! (see the file ROADMAP for
future-functionality), so I'm sure this isn't the last
you've heard about fancylogin.

the file INSTALL describes the basic installation procedure,
follow its instructions, and nothing can actually happen!

NOTE THAT FANCYLOGIN IS NOT COMPATIBLE TO NORMAL login. 
DO NOT REPLACE YOUR NORMAL LOGIN BY FANCYLOGIN. FANCYLOGIN
SHOULD BE USED IN ADDITION TO YOUR NORMAL LOGIN!

(It would also be a good idea to use fancylogin for telnet
just add "-L /bin/fancylogin" to whatever starts in.telnetd
(usually in inetd.conf or an init-script).)
