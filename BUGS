In the original login-program, there was lots of code, which
I didn't really understand, so maybe I've missed some important
things a login-program should do.

The configuration files are put to the screen a little bit
messily. The configuration-files therefore have to have
25*80 (or whatever your terminal uses) characters.

The login is absolutely insecure! We don't log anything,
we don't have a timeout, nor do we exit, after three failed
logins, we have absolutely no error-routines.
